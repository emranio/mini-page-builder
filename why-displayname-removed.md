# Why displayName Was Removed

## Background
Previously, React components throughout the codebase had manual `displayName` assignments like:
```javascript
TextBlockView.displayName = 'TextBlockView';
ImageBlockView.displayName = 'ImageBlockView';
```

## Why displayName Exists
`displayName` is a React feature used **only** for:
1. **React DevTools** - Shows component names in the component tree
2. **Error messages** - Can show more descriptive names in stack traces
3. **Development debugging** - Helps identify components during development

## Why We Removed It

### ✅ **Not Required for Functionality**
- React applications work perfectly without `displayName`
- It has **zero impact** on app performance or behavior
- Only affects debugging experience

### ✅ **Automatic Fallbacks**
React automatically uses:
1. Function name (`function TextBlockView() {}`)
2. Variable name (`const TextBlockView = () => {}`)
3. Generic names for anonymous functions

### ✅ **Maintenance Overhead**
- Every component needed manual assignment
- Easy to forget or get out of sync
- Added boilerplate code with no functional benefit

### ✅ **Modern Development**
- Modern React DevTools are smart enough to infer component names
- Source maps preserve original names in production builds
- Developer experience is fine without explicit displayName

## Result
- **60+ lines of boilerplate removed**
- **Zero functional impact**
- **Cleaner, more maintainable code**
- **One less thing to remember when creating components**

## When You Might Still Use displayName
- Complex HOCs where automatic name inference fails
- Library components that need very specific debugging names
- Components with dynamic names that need explicit labeling

For our page builder, the components have clear, descriptive function names that React DevTools can display automatically, making `displayName` completely unnecessary.
